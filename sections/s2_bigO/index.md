# BigO
## 1. Time
- define: the amount of time to run algorithm.
> [reference](https://adrianmejia.com/how-to-find-time-complexity-of-an-algorithm-code-big-o-notation/)

- basic operations like comparisons, assignments, reading a variable: O(1).
- `if` condition: maxium of both case.
- `loop`: based on how many statement execute in that loop.
- `nested loop`: multiple time complexity of each loop. 
## 2. Space
- the amount of memory space required to solve algorithm.
- array: O(n)
